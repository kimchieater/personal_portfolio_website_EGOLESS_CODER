 This is my personal website



I'm just writing things down (things I know, and things I didn't know.)

This readMe will be treated like my thought flow.


## First I deleted things I needed to delete.

Then I've used built in next/google to 

import font 

![alt text](image-1.png)

This is great for optimasaiton.

### This is what my src/app/layout.tsx looks like
===

## tailwind.config

![alt text](image-4.png)

I added responsivness.



## hero/page.tsx

I also found out that after top-50% left-50% you need to translate x: -50% y:-50%

to center with position:absoulte 


To start off picture mouse trail, I have downloaded 12 images.

Now for optimisaiton, I'm going to use built in Image tag 

https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image


all you need to do is put images in your public folder.

You also need to give it width and height
